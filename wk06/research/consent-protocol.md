# Informed Consent Protocol — Week 6 Peer Interviews

**Module**: COMP2850 Human-Computer Interaction

## Purpose

We are conducting short peer interviews (5-10 minutes) to understand how people use task managers and identify accessibility improvements. This is part of our HCI coursework for Weeks 6-11.

## What You'll Do

I will ask you 3-5 questions about your experience with task management tools (e.g., "Tell me about a time you struggled to find a specific task"). I'll take brief notes. **No recordings** will be made unless you explicitly agree (and I'll ask again before starting).

## Data Collected

- **What I will collect**:
  - Pseudonymised notes (e.g., "Participant A said...")
  - Timestamps of interview
  - Contextual tags (e.g., "Uses keyboard only", "Prefers dark mode")

- **What I will NOT collect**:
  - Your name (unless you want credit in acknowledgements)
  - Student ID number
  - Email address
  - Any other personally identifiable information (PII)

## Data Storage

- **Where**: Local Git repository on my laptop (private repo, not shared publicly)
- **Who can access**: Me, my lab partner, module teaching staff (if requested for marking)
- **How long**: Until end of Semester 1 (January 2025), then deleted OR anonymised for portfolio

## Your Rights (UK GDPR / Data Protection Act 2018)

- **Right to withdraw**: You can stop at any time, no explanation needed
- **Right to access**: You can ask to see your data (I'll show you my notes)
- **Right to erasure**: You can request I delete your data (email me with interview date/pseudonym)
- **Right to complain**: Contact University Data Protection Officer if concerned: dpo@leeds.ac.uk

## Consent Confirmation

Before starting, I will ask:
- [ ] Have I explained the purpose clearly?
- [ ] Do you understand what data I'll collect?
- [ ] Do you know you can stop at any time?
- [ ] Do you consent to participate?

**Verbal consent is sufficient** for this low-risk activity. If you say "yes", I'll note:
- Date/time: [2025-11-19 14:06]
- Pseudonym assigned: [e.g., "Participant A"]
- Consent confirmed: [Initials]

1. Email me at [lmpt3552@leeds.ac.uk]
2. Include: interview date and pseudonym (if you remember it)
3. I will delete all notes related to your session within 48 hours
